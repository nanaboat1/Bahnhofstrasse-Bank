Names: <Nana Boateng > <Amoah>

Project: Bank Simulator

## Deliverable

* Menu system is headed in the right direction.
* I am pleased that effort was put into testing.
* I would encourage you to get feedback sooner on your next program design.
* I like that you stored client data into files, although the format and content of those files needs work.
* Dynamic memory shouild be created in the constructor of the bank class and destroyed in the destructor.
* Client class is a good start for a prototype.
* I am confused why there is no bank class. The clients should be stored in vectors in the bank class. The Bio data for a client should be in the client class not separated out.
* I am confused why there is no checking or savings accounts.
* I am confused why the bank program asks for "Your Name" when you are allowed to create multiple clients for the bank. It should ask instead for "Client Name".  
* Bank tellers would not like having to enter address information twice, instead, you should be given an option to correct data after it has been entered once.
* If it's bank software, it should be generic to be any bank, not just a hard-coded BRN Bank.
  
## Documentation

* Good effort on documentation and pretty good evaluation of what you are doing, but, having other's feedback and input would have made this even better.

## Presentation

### Presentation Feedback

#### One things you really liked?


* It seems like a really useful, detailed program
* I really liked the display aspect that he used. It made the program actually look like a bank website.
* The idea of the project! The login in terminal and the making of accounts is something that many people rely on on a day to day basis, and without it we wouldn't be able to keep privacy of many factors of our lives. This code was great!
* great potential and functionality
* I really like how unique and accurate this is, it looked like I was at the bank getting asked these same questions.
* I liked how much the user could interact with the program (making an account, logging in, depositing/transferring/etc.). The formatting and display also looked very nice.
* Instructions to the user is very clear. Program is well fictionalized.
* I liked the creation of specific classes to perform specific tasks.
* I liked the implementation of the bank saving your bank detail in a separate file.
* The demonstration of the work/ code.
* It has interesting design and idea.
* The clean output

#### What is one thing you would change / modify / add to the project?


* Like you said, it still needs to be finished, but I think you're on the right track.
* I would just add the things that he said he would. He wasn't quite finished yet, but I believe that it would be pretty impressive when he finished what he said he would.
* The project can be made a bit more polished and visually appealing, such as proper spacing on the interface that the user is interacting with. But the code runs well!
* add more login credentials to make it look more realistic
* I would adda receipt program, like when you take money out of aATM and it gives you how much you took out and how much you have remaining.
* One thing to add could be some sort of security question! That could be another thing the user has to set up when creating an account, and part of the log in.
* Could've added more features of the bank such as reopening the account or interest rate for savings bank.
* I would use polymorphism to access client's details for each task.
* I would work on the spacing in the code itself, it was bit messy
* I would start with a clear introduction and highlights of my work and then go through the code.
* if he adds extra choices to more things such as add money and transfer money to other people but it looks he worked very well.
* Video didn't show much of code, maybe explain a little more


#### General Feedback

* Great job! This is a cool idea and I loved how you implemented your pin number to get into an account.
* Great work!
